### Description:
We have asked for a freelance job on an online freelance software development marketplace but unfortunately the person that accepted the work had to leave the project for personal reasons.

So it's here where we need you help.

It seems that all the routes related to the deliveries aren't working, and for what I've seen, there's a little bug that will delete the wrong pin on the map too.

Can you please fix it?
